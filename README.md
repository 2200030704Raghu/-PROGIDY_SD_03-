Develop a program that allows users to store and manage contact information. The program should provide options to add a new contact by entering their name, phone number, and email address. It should also allow users to view their contact list, edit existing contacts, and delete contacts if needed. The program should store the contacts in memory or in a file for persistent storage.

Editing a Contact: The edit_contact function allows the user to edit the phone number and email of an existing contact.
